# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
For this project, I needed to use JavaScript to create a password generator. JS was much more of a struggle for me than the CSS project last week, and so I did not have neought time to get too creative with the interface. 


In completing this project, I now have a functioning password generator that I can show as a usable representation of some (very basic) JS skills. The usershould be presented with prompts to state the length of a password that they want, and then be given prompts for four different variables to include or exclude in their password.

I learned more about JavaScript in this project, and am learning that it is really what makes a site "work" for a user; taking input and outputting results from that point. 

I also learned that this is NOT intuitive to me. I spent a long time Googling things, re-watching class videos to try and catch myself up to the content, and still have a long ways to go before I truly understand what it is that my own codes even do! I look forward to the learning journey ahead of me.
